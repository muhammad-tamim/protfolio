## About

My name is Muhammad Tamim. My journey in programming started after I faced some tough times in life, including dropping out of university and starting a job to support my family. But I never gave up. I taught myself web development, and now I am a confident MERN stack developer.

I love building web apps that solve real problems. Writing clean and efficient code makes me happy. I enjoy learning new technologies and improving my skills every day.

Outside programming, I enjoy playing football to stay active and clear my mind. I also like painting and digital art, which help me think creatively and bring fresh ideas to my work.

Overall, Iâ€™m a hardworking and focused developer who believes in learning from challenges and growing both personally and professionally.
